# PubSub-Model

Pub/Sub is a messaging pattern used in distributed systems, where senders (publishers) send messages to one or more receivers (subscribers) through an intermediary (message broker or Pub/Sub system).
Pub/Sub enables loose coupling and scalability in distributed systems, making it easy to add or remove components without affecting the rest of the system, and is commonly used in cloud-based systems to provide scalable and reliable messaging infrastructure.
